# NYC shooting incident analysis base on NYPD data, 2006 - 2021
Given data spaning from January 2006 to December 2021, is it possible to answer the followng questions:
1. How have the number of shooting incidents changed over time? Have they changed periodically, have they remained constant over time, have they been increasing or decreasing? Has the same been true for murders?
2. Are shooting rates a predictor of murder rates?
3. Have particular ethnic groups been the target of shooting incidents? Has one group been the victim more often than others, have different groups become the majority victimized group over time or has it been roughly consistently one group over time?
